Name:
  wc

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Description:
  wc prints newline, word, and byte counts for each FILE, and a total if more
  than one FILE is specified. With no FILE, or when FILE is a dash ("-"), wc
  operates on standard input. (A word is a non-zero-length sequence of
  characters delimited by white space.)

  The options below may be used to select which counts are printed. Counts are
  always in the following order: newline, word, character, byte, maximum line
  length.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Syntax:
  wc [options]... [file]...

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Options:
   -c
   --bytes
   --chars
        Print only the byte counts.

   -w
   --words
        Print only the word counts.

   -l
   --lines
        Print only the newline counts.

   -L
   --max-line-length
        Print only the length of the longest line per file, and if there is more
        than one file it prints the maximum (not the sum) of those lengths.

  'wc' prints one line of counts for each file, and if the file was given as an
  argument, it prints the file name following the counts.

  If more than one FILE is given, 'wc' prints a final line containing the
  cumulative counts, with the file name 'total'. The counts are printed in this
  order: newlines, words, bytes.

  By default, each count is output right-justified in a 7-byte field with one
  space between fields so that the numbers and file names line up nicely in
  columns. However, POSIX requires that there be exactly one space separating
  columns. You can make 'wc' use the POSIX-mandated output format by setting the
  'POSIXLY_CORRECT' environment variable.

  By default, 'wc' prints all three counts. Options can specify that only
  certain counts be printed. Options do not undo others previously given, so wc
  --bytes --wordswill print both the byte counts and the word counts.

  The command grep -c will also count the number of matching lines, grep -c is
  faster than piping grep to wc -l

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Examples:
  Count the number of lines in file1.txt
  $ wc -l < file1.txt

  Count the number of words in file2.txt
  $ wc -w file2.txt
