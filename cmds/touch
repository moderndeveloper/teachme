Name:
  touch

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Description:
  Change file timestamps, change the access and/or modification times of the
  specified files.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Syntax:
  touch [options]... File...

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Options:
  -a
  --time=atime
  --time=access
  --time=use
      Change the access time only.

  -c
  --no-create
      Do not create files that do not exist.

  -d
  --date=time
      Use time instead of the current time.  It can contain month names,
      timezones, 'am' and 'pm', etc.

  -f   Ignored; for compatibility with BSD versions of 'touch'.

  -m
  --time=mtime
  --time=modify
      Change the modification time only.

  -r FILE
  --reference=FILE
      Use the times of the reference FILE instead of the current time.

  -t [[CC]YY]MMDDhhmm[.ss]
      Set to a specific time.

  The -t argument will accept four-digit or two-digit years, specifying the
  seconds is optional. If no digits of the year are specified, the argument is
  interpreted as a date in the current year.

  If two-digit year is specified, then CC is 20 for years in the range 0 ... 68,
  and 19 for year in 69 ... 99.

  If the first FILE would be a valid argument to the '-t' option and no
  timestamp is given with any of the '-d', '-r', or '-t' options and the '--'
  argument is not given, that argument is interpreted as the time for the other
  files instead of as a file name.

  Any FILE that does not exist is created empty.

  If changing both the access and modification times to the current time,
  'touch' can change the timestamps for files that the user running it does not
  own but has write permission for. Otherwise, the user must own the files.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Examples:
  # Create/datestamp one file called sample.txt:
  $ touch sample.txt

  # Create/datestamp 10 files called file1, file2 etc:
  $ touch file{1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10}

  # Create/datestamp 100 files called file1, file2 etc:
  $ for i in \$(seq 1 100); do echo -n "file\${i} "; touch file\${i} 2>&1; done

EOF

exit 0
