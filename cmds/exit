# the command's description
echo "Exit is a command or option used to close a program or file.

The exit command is used to terminate a shell script upon an error and indicate to the user whether or not the script termination was successful. 

On termination, programs will pass a value to their parent process. This value is referred to as an exit code or exit status. The standard convention for a program is to pass 0 for successful execution and 1 or higher for failed execution. Providing exit codes is important when scripts are used in other scripts. It allows these scripts to verify if they are running successfully or not, allowing them to operate appropriately.
