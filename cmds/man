Name:
  man

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Description:
  Format and display help pages.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Syntax:
  man [-acdfFhkKtwW] [--path] [-m system] [-p string] [-C config_file]
      [-M pathlist] [-P pager] [-B browser] [-H htmlpager] [-S section_list]
      [section] name ...

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Options:
  -C config_file  The configuration file to use; the default is /etc/man.config.
                  (See man.config(5).)

  -M path         The list of directories to search for man pages. Separate the
                  directories with colons. An empty list is the same as not
                  specifying -M at all.
                  See SEARCH PATH FOR MANUAL PAGES.

  -P pager        Which pager to use. This option overrides the MANPAGER
                  environment variable, which in turn overrides the PAGER
                  variable.
                  By default, man uses /usr/bin/less -is.

  -B              Which browser to use on HTML files. This option overrides the
                  BROWSER environment variable.
                  By default, man uses /usr/bin/less-is,

  -H              Specify a command that renders HTML files as text. This option
                  overrides the HTMLPAGER environment variable.
                  By default, man uses /bin/cat,

  -S section_list List is a colon separated list of manual sections to search.
                  This option overrides the MANSECT environment variable.

  -a              By default, man will exit after displaying the first manual
                  page it finds. Using this option forces man to display all the
                  manual pages that match name, not just the first.

  -c              Reformat the source man page, even when an up-to-date cat page
                  exists. This can be meaningful if the cat page was formatted
                  for a screen with a different number of columns, or if the
                  preformatted page is corrupted.

  -d              Don't actually display the man pages, but do print gobs of
                  debugging information.

  -D              Both display and print debugging info.

  -f              Equivalent to whatis.

  -F
  --preformat     Format only - do not display.

  -h              Print a help message and exit.

  -k              Equivalent to apropos.

  -K              Search for the specified string in *all* man pages.
                  Warning: this can be very slow and can match multiple pages!
                  It helps to specify a section.

  -m system       Specify an alternate set of man pages to search based on the
                  system name given.

  -p string       Specify the sequence of preprocessors to run before nroff or
                  troff. Not all installations will have a full set of
                  preprocessors. Some of the preprocessors and the letters used
                  to designate them: eqn (e), grap (g), pic (p), tbl (t), vgrind
                  (v), refer (r). This option overrides the MANROFFSEQ
                  environment variable.

  -t              Use /usr/bin/groff -Tps -mandoc to format the manual page,
                  passing the output to stdout. The default output format of
                  /usr/bin/groff -Tps -mandoc is Postscript, refer to the manual
                  page of /usr/bin/groff -Tps -mandoc for ways to pick an
                  alternate format. Depending on the selected format and the
                  availability of printing devices, the output may need to be
                  passed through some filter or another before being printed.

  -w
  --path          Don't actually display the man pages, but do print the
                  location(s) of the files that would be formatted or displayed.
                  If no argument is given: display (on stdout) the list of
                  directories that is searched by man for man pages. If manpath
                  is a link to man, then "manpath" is equivalent to "man
                  --path".

  -W              Like -w, but print file names one per line, without additional
                  information. This is useful in shell commands like man -aW man
                  | xargs ls -l

  Man displays help pages. If you specify section, man only looks in that
  section of the manual. name is normally the name of the manual page, which is
  typically the name of a command, function, or file. However, if name contains
  a slash (/) then man interprets it as a file specification, so that you can do
  man ./foo.5 or even man /cd/foo/bar.1.gz. See below for a description of where
  man looks for the manual page files.

  $ man rsync
