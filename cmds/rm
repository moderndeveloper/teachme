echo "This command is used to remove a specified file or files. By default, it does not remove directories.

This command usually deletes one file at a time however there is an option that allows this behaviour to change. It should also be noted that if the file to be deleted does not have write permissions, a prompt for confirmation is given before the command is executed."
