echo -e 'git merge'

# the command's description
echo "Merging takes the changes from one branch (in the same repository or from a fork), and applies them into another. This often happens as a pull request (a request to merge), or via the command line, but can also be done by using the merge command.

Merge is a non-destrucitve operation that ties together the histories of both branches. It's non-destructive in that the existing branches are not changed in any way, allowing you to go back to previous commits on either of the branches if neccesary."

echo -e "\t[option: --no-edit] - Use git merge with the auto-generated merge commit message."
echo -e "\t[option: --edit] - Will invoke an editor before committing a merge to edit the auto-generated merge comment, so that the user can explain and justify the merge."
echo -e "\t[option: --no-commit] - Enable git merge to merge only and not make a new commit automatically."

# example 2
echo "git merge --no-commit improve-readme"
echo "This example does the same thing as the above example. However, the merge will not be automatically committed, to give the user a chance to inspect and further optimize the merge before committing."

# example 3
echo "git merge --edit improve-readme"
echo "Specifying the --edit option will start an editor to provide an explanation for the merge."
