echo -e 'git merge'

# the command's description
echo "Merging takes the changes from one branch (in the same repository or from a fork), and applies them into another. This often happens as a pull request (a request to merge), or via the command line, but can also be done by using the merge command.

Merge is a non-destrucitve operation that ties together the histories of both branches. It's non-destructive in that the existing branches are not changed in any way, allowing you to go back to previous commits on either of the branches if neccesary."

echo "This example does the same thing as the above example. However, the merge will not be automatically committed, to give the user a chance to inspect and further optimize the merge before committing."
