Name:
  more

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Description:
  Display output one screen at a time, less provides more emulation and
  extensive enhancements.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Syntax:
  more [-dlfpcsu] [-num] [+/ pattern] [+ linenum] [file ...]

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Options:
  Command line options are described below.  Options are also taken from the
  environment variable MORE (make sure to precede them with a dash ('-')) but
  command line options will override them.

  -num  This option specifies an integer which is the screen size (in
        lines).

  -d    more will prompt the user with the message "[Press space to continue,
        'q' to quit.]" and will display "[Press 'h' for instructions.]"
        instead of ringing the bell when an illegal key is pressed.

  -l    more usually treats ^L (form feed) as a special character, and will
        pause after any line that contains a form feed.  The -l option will
        prevent this behavior.

  -f    Causes more to count logical, rather than screen lines (i.e., long
        lines are not folded).

  -p    Do not scroll.  Instead, clear the whole screen and then display
        the text.
  -c    Do not scroll.  Instead, paint each screen from the top, clearing
        the remainder of each line as it is displayed.

  -s    Squeeze multiple blank lines into one.

  -u    Suppress underlining.

  +/    The +/ option specifies a string that will be searched for before
        each file is displayed.

  +num  Start at line number num.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  preceeded by a decimal number, called k in the descriptions below.  In the
  following descriptions, ^X means control-X.
