# the command's description
echo "Grep stands for \"global regular expression print\", it processes text line by line and prints any lines which match a specified pattern. It is one of the most useful and powerful commands on Linux and other Unix-like operating systems because of its utilization of regular expressions.

A regular expression is a sequence of characters that define a search pattern, mainly for use in pattern matching with strings. Grep is a powerful tool for matching a regular expression against text in a file, multiple files, or a stream of input. It searches for the pattern of text that you specify on the command line, and outputs the results."
