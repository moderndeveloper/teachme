echo 'chmod stands for change mode, it is used to change the permissions of files or directories.
In the system,there are three kinds of permissions:read, write and executable. Also, there are
four kinds of user groups: user who owns the files,users in the group to which the file belong,
users are not in the file group, and all the other non-owner users. In the Unix-like system,
there is a set of rules for each files which defines who can access that file, and how they can access it.
So chmode command is used to define the way a file can be accessed. '
