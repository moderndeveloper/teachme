Name:
  pipe

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Description:
  Redirect the output from one command as input for another.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Syntax:
  A pipeline is a sequence of simple commands separated by '|'.

  The format for a pipeline is

  [time [-p]] [!] command1 [| command2 ...] The output of each command in the
  pipeline is connected to the input of the next command. That is, each command
  reads the previous command's output.

  The reserved word time causes timing statistics to be printed for the pipeline
  once it finishes. The statistics currently consist of elapsed (wall-clock)
  time and user and system time consumed by the command's execution. 

  The '-p' option changes the output format to that specified by POSIX.

  The TIMEFORMAT variable can be set to a format string that specifies how the
  timing information should be displayed. The use of time as a reserved word
  permits the timing of shell builtins, shell functions, and pipelines. An
  external time command cannot time these easily.

  If the pipeline is not executed asynchronously, the shell waits for all
    commands in the pipeline to complete.

  Each command in a pipeline is executed in its own subshell. The exit status of
  a pipeline is the exit status of the last command in the pipeline. If the
  reserved word '!' precedes the pipeline, the exit status is the logical
  negation of the exit status of the last command.

Examples:
  # Returns the number of objects in the current directory
  $ ls -1 | wc -l

exit 0
